# boring-avatars-esm

An action to release a ESM version of the awesome [`boring-avatars`](https://github.com/boringdesigners/boring-avatars), which is now available only in [CJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) and breaks when imported in ESM only projects for some unknown and unexplored reason.
